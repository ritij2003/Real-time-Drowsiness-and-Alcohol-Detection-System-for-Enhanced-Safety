# Real-time-Drowsiness-and-Alcohol-Detection-System-for-Enhanced-Safety
The project aims to develop a robust real-time system capable of detecting both drowsiness and alcohol impairment in individuals, particularly in scenarios such as driving or operating heavy machinery, where these factors pose significant risks to safety. By integrating sensors and advanced signal processing techniques.
